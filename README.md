# [NooredOl-mpiale](http://www.nooredolumpiale.ee/)
This was a pro bono project in collaboration with Design company velvet
## The website is deployed on Voog CMS
1. I worked together with Estonian design company Velvet.
2. Velvet provided me the PSD files and I had to convert the PSD to web
3. I learned a lot about JS Framework calles Scrollmagic.
4. In this project I used Sass/Scss for Styling the website.
5. For DOM manipulation I used vanilla JS and some additional JQuery.
6. Most Valuable lesson: Organize your SASS files before starting the development of the website.
